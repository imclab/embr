Embr is a helper library which attempts to enable sharing code between Plask and WebGL. It is considered experimental and under heavy development.

Embr borrows ideas and code from the following:

Cinder - http://github.com/cinder/Cinder
Plask  - http://github.com/deanm/plask
PreGL  - http://github.com/deanm/pregl
